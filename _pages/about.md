I am Yunjia Zhang, a Ph.D. candidate majoring in Computer Sciences at [Department of Computer Sciences](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/), [University of Wisconsin-Madison](www.wisc.edu) (Madison, WI, US). Currently, I am in [Database Group](https://database.cs.wisc.edu), under the supervision of [Prof. Theodoros (Theo) Rekatsinas](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~thodrek/) (currently at Apple) and [Prof. Jignesh M. Patel](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jignesh/) (currently at CMU). I am also in strong collaboration with [Microsoft GSL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/gray-systems-lab/), and my mentor at GSL is [Avrilia Floratou](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/avflor/). I got my B.Eng in Computer Science at [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn). 
<!-- Previously, I had experience working as research assistant at SKLSE @ Wuhan University (supervisor: [Prof.Hao Huang](https://faculty.whu.edu.cn/show.jsp?lang=en&n=Hao%20Huang)), SCALE @ [Nanyang Technological University](http://www.ntu.edu.sg) (supervisor: [Prof.Gao Cong](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/gaocong/)) and [Database Research Lab](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dbsystem/team.html) @ [National University of Singapore](www.nus.edu.sg) (supervisor: [Prof.Xiaokui Xiao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiaoxk/)). -->

I have a broad interest in many topics in databases, especifically AI4DB. I am devoted to improving the data scientists' pipeline, providing them with easier-to-use and faster-to-execute analytic tools. I am currently focusing on LLMs for databases and efficient query processing.
